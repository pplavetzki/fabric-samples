# Watcher Ledger Event Application

This application is used to receive events triggered from the chaincode.  In this example, we show all three options of how this can be accomplished.

1. Listen on the channel
2. Listen on the network
3. Listen for contract events

## Listening on the network

This gives you block data of the event

## Listening for contract events

This will give you the event and the payload
